# SOEN357 - Project

# Objective
- Our goal is to be able to develop an application that can lessen people’s worries and anxiety
about the various tasks they need to accomplish throughout the day for their pets. We
believe that pets’ health is of uppermost importance, and since their health is relative to the
owner’s well-being, we aim to provide functionalities that can be used easily by pet owners.
